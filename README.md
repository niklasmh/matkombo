# All possible food combinations (in Norwegian)

Just a huge list of foods that people have mixed together in the past (and liked), like [Coke and ice cream](https://www.google.com/search?q=coke+and+ice+cream). The reason for making this into a webapp is to make it easier to explore new combinations as well as being able to contribute with new food combinations that is not listed.

Currently everyone can add food combinations, but if it starts to attract too much spam (literally spam) more restrictions will be added. So please be kind :)

# SetUp

You should not need to do this, but if you are interested, you can download and try to run the project. It is just a normal `create-react-app` setup:

```bash
yarn # Dependencies
yarn start # Open in browser
